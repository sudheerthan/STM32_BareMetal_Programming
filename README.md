# Bare-metal STM32 Project

This repository contains bare-metal STM32 project code developed without using any Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The projects are compiled with the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler and flashed onto STM32 microcontrollers using ST-Link.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development environment:

- **arm-none-eabi-gcc**: The GNU Compiler Collection toolchain for compiling ARM-based applications.
- **ST-Link Utility**: Software utility for flashing firmware onto STM32 microcontrollers.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to compile and flash the project onto your STM32 microcontroller:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory.

3. **Compile the Project**: Compile the project using `arm-none-eabi-gcc`.

4. **Flash the Binary**: Flash the compiled binary onto your STM32 microcontroller using ST-Link.

## Usage

Modify the code in the project files (e.g., `main.c`) to customize the functionality or add new features as needed.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
